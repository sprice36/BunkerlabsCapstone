                Bunker Labs Marketplace Atlanta is a space 
                where users can view and connect with veteran-owned
                businesses. Even though each business is unique, 
                they all share a common trait in being owned or managed 
                by a military veteran here in Atlanta. Our online platform 
                displays each company's logo, their title, a summary of
                their business, up to three needs the company may have, 
                their contact information, their website, a picture of 
                the CEO or owner, the company's industry and the current 
                stage that the company is in. We believe each veteran 
                entrepreneur should have access to all of the resources 
                available and this platform allows them to market their 
                company to future employees, investors, or volunteers.
